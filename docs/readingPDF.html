 [5] "                     — CHAPTER ONE —\n\n\n\n         The Boy Who Lived\nMr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to\nsay that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They\nwere the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything\nstrange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such\nnonsense.\n    Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which\nmade drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck,\nalthough he did have a very large moustache. Mrs Dursley was\nthin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck,\nwhich came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning\nover garden fences, spying on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a\nsmall son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer\nboy anywhere.\n    The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a\nsecret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover\nit. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about\nthe Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t\nmet for several years; in fact, Mrs Dursley pretended she didn’t\nhave a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband\nwere as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys\nshuddered to think what the neighbours would say if the Potters\narrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a\nsmall son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was\nanother good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t\nwant Dudley mixing with a child like that.\n    When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, grey Tuesday\nour story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to\nsuggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be hap-\npening all over the country. Mr Dursley hummed as he picked out\nhis most boring tie for work and Mrs Dursley gossiped away\n"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 [6] "8                          HARRY POTTER\n\nhappily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.\n    None of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the window.\n    At half past eight, Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked\nMrs Dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss Dudley goodbye but\nmissed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing\nhis cereal at the walls. ‘Little tyke,’ chortled Mr Dursley as he left\nthe house. He got into his car and backed out of number four’s\ndrive.\n    It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign\nof something peculiar – a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr\nDursley didn’t realise what he had seen – then he jerked his head\naround to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner\nof Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What could\nhe have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light.\nMr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr\nDursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the\ncat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive\n– no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr\nDursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his\nmind. As he drove towards town he thought of nothing except a\nlarge order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\n    But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by\nsomething else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he\ncouldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely\ndressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr Dursley couldn’t bear\npeople who dressed in funny clothes – the get-ups you saw on\nyoung people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He\ndrummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a\nhuddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whis-\npering excitedly together. Mr Dursley was enraged to see that a\ncouple of them weren’t young at all; why, that man had to be older\nthan he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of\nhim! But then it struck Mr Dursley that this was probably some\nsilly stunt – these people were obviously collecting for something\n... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on, and a few minutes\nlater, Mr Dursley arrived in the Grunnings car park, his mind\nback on drills.\n    Mr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office\non the ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to\nconcentrate on drills that morning. He didn’t see the owls\n"

Most of them had never seen an owl even at night-\ntime. Mr Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morn-\ning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important\ntelephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good\nmood until lunch-time, when he thought he’d stretch his legs\nand walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the baker’s\nopposite.\n    He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a\ngroup of them next to the baker’s. He eyed them angrily as he\npassed. He didn’t know why, but they made him uneasy. This lot\nwere whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn’t see a single\ncollecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large\ndoughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were\nsaying.\n    ‘The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard –’\n    ‘– yes, their son, Harry –’\n    Mr Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at\nthe whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but\nthought better of it.\n    He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office,\nsnapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone\nand had almost finished dialling his home number when he\nchanged his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his\nmoustache, thinking ... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn’t\nsuch an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people\ncalled Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he\nwasn’t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He’d never even\nseen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no\npoint in worrying Mrs Dursley, she always got so upset at any\nmention of her sister. He didn’t blame her – if he’d had a sister like\nthat ... but all the same, those people in cloaks ...\n    He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon,\nand when he left the building at five o’clock, he was still so\nworried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.\n    ‘Sorry,’ he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost\nfell. It was a few seconds before Mr Dursley realised that the man\nwas wearing a violet cloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at being\nalmost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into\n"

Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even\nMuggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy happy\nday!’\n     And the old man hugged Mr Dursley around the middle and\nwalked off.\n     Mr Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a\ncomplete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle,\nwhatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set\noff home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never\nhoped before, because he didn’t approve of imagination.\n     As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he\nsaw – and it didn’t improve his mood – was the tabby cat he’d\nspotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was\nsure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.\n     ‘Shoo!’ said Mr Dursley loudly.\n     The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this nor-\nmal cat behaviour, Mr Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself\ntogether, he let himself into the house. He was still determined\nnot to mention anything to his wife.\n     Mrs Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over din-\nner all about Mrs Next Door’s problems with her daughter and\nhow Dudley had learnt a new word (‘Shan’t!’). Mr Dursley tried to\nact normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the\nliving-room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:\n     And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the\nnation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although\nowls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight,\nthere have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in\nevery direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why\nthe owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.’ The news\nreader allowed himself a grin. ‘Most mysterious. And now, over to\nJim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of\nowls tonight, Jim?’\n     ‘Well, Ted,’ said the weatherman, ‘I don’t know about that, but\nit’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as\nfar apart as Kent, Yorkshire and Dundee have been phoning in\nto tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve\nhad a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been\n"

Shooting stars all over\nBritain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all\nover the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters ...\n    Mrs Dursley came into the living-room carrying two cups of\ntea. It was no good. He’d have to say something to her. He cleared\nhis throat nervously. ‘Er – Petunia, dear – you haven’t heard from\nyour sister lately, have you?’\n    As he had expected, Mrs Dursley looked shocked and angry.\nAfter all, they normally pretended she didn’t have a sister.\n    ‘No,’ she said sharply. ‘Why?’\n    ‘Funny stuff on the news,’ Mr Dursley mumbled. ‘Owls ...\nshooting stars ... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in\ntown today ...’\n    ‘So?’ snapped Mrs Dursley.\n    ‘Well, I just thought ... maybe ... it was something to do with ...\nyou know ... her lot.’\n    Mrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr Dursley\nwondered whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name ‘Potter’.\nHe decided he didn’t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could,\n‘Their son – he’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?’\n    ‘I suppose so,’ said Mrs Dursley stiffly.\n    ‘What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?’\n    ‘Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.’\n    ‘Oh, yes,’ said Mr Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. ‘Yes, I\nquite agree.’\n    He didn’t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs\nto bed. While Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr Dursley crept\nto the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden.\nThe cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though\nit was waiting for something.\n    Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do\nwith the Potters? If it did ... if it got out that they were related to a\npair of – well, he didn’t think he could bear it.\n    The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly but\nMr Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last,\ncomforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the\nPotters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near\nhim and Mrs Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and\n"

He yawned and turned over. It couldn’t affect them ...\n    How very wrong he was.\n    Mr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but\nthe cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It\nwas sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the\nfar corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so much as quiver when a car\ndoor slammed in the next street, nor when two owls swooped\noverhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\n    A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching,\nappeared so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just\npopped out of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes\nnarrowed.\n    Nothing like this man had ever been seen in Privet Drive. He\nwas tall, thin and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and\nbeard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was\nwearing long robes, a purple cloak which swept the ground and\nhigh-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright and\nsparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long\nand crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This\nman’s name was Albus Dumbledore.\n    Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realise that he had just\narrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots\nwas unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for\nsomething. But he did seem to realise he was being watched,\nbecause he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring\nat him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight\nof the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, ‘I\nshould have known.’\n    He had found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It\nseemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it\nup in the air and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with\na little pop. He clicked it again – the next lamp flickered into\ndarkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only\nlights left in the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the dis-\ntance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone\nlooked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs Dursley,\nthey wouldn’t be able to see anything that was happening down\non the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside\n"

He didn’t look at it, but\nafter a moment he spoke to it.\n    ‘Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.’\n    He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was\nsmiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square\nglasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around\nits eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black\nhair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.\n    ‘How did you know it was me?’ she asked.\n    ‘My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.’\n    ‘You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,’ said\nProfessor McGonagall.\n    ‘All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have\npassed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.’\n    Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\n    ‘Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,’ she said impatiently.\n‘You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, but no – even the\nMuggles have noticed something’s going on. It was on their news.’\nShe jerked her head back at the Dursleys’ dark living-room\nwindow. ‘I heard it. Flocks of owls ... shooting stars ... Well,\nthey’re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice\nsomething. Shooting stars down in Kent – I’ll bet that was Dedalus\nDiggle. He never had much sense.’\n    ‘You can’t blame them,’ said Dumbledore gently. ‘We’ve had\nprecious little to celebrate for eleven years.’\n    ‘I know that,’ said Professor McGonagall irritably. ‘But that’s no\nreason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out\non the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle\nclothes, swapping rumours.’\n    She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as\nthough hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn’t,\nso she went on: ‘A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-\nKnow-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found\nout about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?’\n    ‘It certainly seems so,’ said Dumbledore. ‘We have much to be\nthankful for. Would you care for a sherbet lemon?’\n    ‘A what?’\n    ‘A sherbet lemon. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m rather\nfond of.’\n"

All this “You-Know-Who” nonsense – for\neleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by\nhis proper name: Voldemort.’ Professor McGonagall flinched, but\nDumbledore, who was unsticking two sherbet lemons, seemed\nnot to notice. ‘It all gets so confusing if we keep saying “You-\nKnow-Who”.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of\nsaying Voldemort’s name.’\n    ‘I know you haven’t,’ said Professor McGonagall, sounding half-\nexasperated, half-admiring. ‘But you’re different. Everyone knows\nyou’re the only one You-Know – oh, all right, Voldemort – was\nfrightened of.’\n    ‘You flatter me,’ said Dumbledore calmly. ‘Voldemort had\npowers I will never have.’\n    ‘Only because you’re too – well – noble to use them.’\n    ‘It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam\nPomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.’\n    Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and\nsaid, ‘The owls are nothing to the rumours that are flying around.\nYou know what everyone’s saying? About why he’s disappeared?\nAbout what finally stopped him?’\n    It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she\nwas most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting\non a cold hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman\nhad she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did\nnow. It was plain that whatever ‘everyone’ was saying, she was not\ngoing to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true.\nDumbledore, however, was choosing another sherbet lemon and\ndid not answer.\n    ‘What they’re saying,’ she pressed on, ‘is that last night Voldemort\nturned up in Godric’s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The\nrumour is that Lily and James Potter are – are – that they’re –\ndead.’\n    Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.\n    ‘Lily and James ... I can’t believe it ... I didn’t want to believe it\n... Oh, Albus ...’\n    Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. ‘I\n"

They’re saying he tried to kill the Potters’ son, Harry. But –\nhe couldn’t. He couldn’t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or\nhow, but they’re saying that when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter,\nVoldemort’s power somehow broke – and that’s why he’s gone.’\n    Dumbledore nodded glumly.\n    ‘It’s – it’s true?’ faltered Professor McGonagall. ‘After all he’s\ndone ... all the people he’s killed ... he couldn’t kill a little boy? It’s\njust astounding ... of all the things to stop him ... but how in the\nname of heaven did Harry survive?’\n    ‘We can only guess,’ said Dumbledore. ‘We may never know.’\n    Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and\ndabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a\ngreat sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined\nit. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers;\ninstead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have\nmade sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his\npocket and said, ‘Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you\nI’d be here, by the way?’\n    ‘Yes,’ said Professor McGonagall. ‘And I don’t suppose you’re\ngoing to tell me why you’re here, of all places?’\n    ‘I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the\nonly family he has left now.’\n    ‘You don’t mean – you can’t mean the people who live here?’\ncried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at\nnumber four. ‘Dumbledore – you can’t. I’ve been watching them\nall day. You couldn’t find two people who are less like us. And\nthey’ve got this son – I saw him kicking his mother all the way up\nthe street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!’\n    ‘It’s the best place for him,’ said Dumbledore firmly. ‘His aunt\nand uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he’s\nolder. I’ve written them a letter.’\n    ‘A letter?’ repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back\ndown on the wall. ‘Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain\nall this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He’ll\nbe famous – a legend – I wouldn’t be surprised if today was\nknown as Harry Potter Day in future – there will be books written\nabout Harry – every child in our world will know his name!’\n    ‘Exactly,’ said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top\n"

Famous for something\nhe won’t even remember! Can’t you see how much better off he’ll\nbe, growing up away from all that until he’s ready to take it?’\n    Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind,\nswallowed and then said, ‘Yes – yes, you’re right, of course. But\nhow is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?’ She eyed his cloak\nsuddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry\nunderneath it.\n    ‘Hagrid’s bringing him.’\n    ‘You think it – wise – to trust Hagrid with something as impor-\ntant as this?’\n    ‘I would trust Hagrid with my life,’ said Dumbledore.\n    ‘I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,’ said Professor\nMcGonagall grudgingly, ‘but you can’t pretend he’s not careless.\nHe does tend to – what was that?’\n    A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It\ngrew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for\nsome sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked\nup at the sky – and a huge motorbike fell out of the air and landed\non the road in front of them.\n    If the motorbike was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting\nastride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least\nfive times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so\nwild – long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his\nface, he had hands the size of dustbin lids and his feet in their\nleather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms\nhe was holding a bundle of blankets.\n    ‘Hagrid,’ said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. ‘At last. And\nwhere did you get that motorbike?’\n    ‘Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,’ said the giant, climbing\ncarefully off the motorbike as he spoke. ‘Young Sirius Black lent it\nme. I’ve got him, sir.’\n    ‘No problems, were there?’\n    ‘No, sir – house was almost destroyed but I got him out all\nright before the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell asleep\nas we was flyin’ over Bristol.’\n    Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the\nbundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep.\nUnder a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a\n"

Scars can come in useful. I have\none myself above my left knee which is a perfect map of the\nLondon Underground. Well – give him here, Hagrid – we’d better\nget this over with.’\n    Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned towards the\nDursleys’ house.\n    ‘Could I – could I say goodbye to him, sir?’ asked Hagrid.\n    He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what\nmust have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly,\nHagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.\n    ‘Shhh!’ hissed Professor McGonagall. ‘You’ll wake the Muggles!’\n    ‘S-s-sorry,’ sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large spotted handker-\nchief and burying his face in it. ‘But I c-c-can’t stand it – Lily an’\nJames dead – an’ poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles –’\n    ‘Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or\nwe’ll be found,’ Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid\ngingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden\nwall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the\ndoorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry’s\nblankets and then came back to the other two. For a full minute\nthe three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s\nshoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously and the\ntwinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed\nto have gone out.\n    ‘Well,’ said Dumbledore finally, ‘that’s that. We’ve no business\nstaying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.’\n    ‘Yeah,’ said Hagrid in a very muffled voice. ‘I’d best get\nthis bike away.

He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of\nnumber four.\n    ‘Good luck, Harry,’ he murmured. He turned on his heel and\nwith a swish of his cloak he was gone.\n    A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay\nsilent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would\nexpect astonishing things to happen.
